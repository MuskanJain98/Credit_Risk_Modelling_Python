# Credit_Risk_Modelling_Python
Credit Risk modelling on Consumer Loans. The dataset contains all available data for more than 800,000 consumer loans issued from 2007 to 2015 by Lending Club: a large US peer-to-peer lending company. Divided the data into two periods because it is assumed that some data are available at the moment when needed to build Expected Loss models, and some data would come from applications after. 

•	Took Lending Club’s Loan data containing 890,000 variables like loan amount, issue date, income, loan status for consumer loans in the USA.
•	Pre-processed the data using Pandas and NumPy libraries. 
•	Built Probability of Default (PD) model using Logistic Regression. 
•	Built Loss Given Default (LD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) model using Beta Regression
•	Used PD, LGD and EAD models to calculate Expected Loss for every borrower
